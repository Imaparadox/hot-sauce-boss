# Hot Sauce Boss

This application is the final group project for the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.

## Description 

Scenerio: you're having a late-night dinner, and you're craving some hot sauce to go with your side of delicious wings. You open your fridge to reach for all those handy, flavor-filled sauces. You panic. You forgot to get the most important part of your meal. The hot sauce!!! 

Luckily for you, you have your handy-dandy Hot Sauce Boss app to help you with selecting some replacement sauces. With this app you'll be able to see other user's hot sauce selections, so you don't have to worry about scrounging around for a new sauce. You can even make an account to add your own future recommendations!

Always remember for every meal, the sauce is the boss!
